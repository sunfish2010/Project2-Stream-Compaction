## Introduction

In this project, stream compaction is implemented using the traditional CPU approach, a naive CUDA based scan algorithm and a more efficient algorithm that performs the scan in place. This project can be used as a base work for many useful things like path tracer. 

Stream compaction usually includes two processes: scan followed by compaction. 

Below is a visualization of how scan and compaction works:

For CPU implementation, scan is basically just an for loop iterating through all the elements and produce the outputs.

For the naive GPU implementation, scan is done using two ping-pong buffers since the algorithm requires inplace updates of the array.

For the efficient GPU implementation, scan is done smartly using up-sweep and down-sweep, which reduces the amount of computation significantly.

## Performance Analysis 
The performance of these three different algorithms are shown in the diagram below.
